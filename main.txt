Generative AI -> branch of AI -> focuses:
	Creating new content:
		text, images, audio, or even computer code, 
	from existing data. 

learn patterns/relationships from training data -> generate entirely new content.

E.g. 
1. text generation -> Amazon Titan and Anthropicâ€™s Claude -> human-like writing on virtually any topic
2. Generative AI Model -> (Computer Vision) -> Stable Diffusion -> create  visual images -> simple text prompts.


ML process starts -> collecting and processing training data. 
Bad data -> garbage in, garbage out, 


Labeled data -> label or target variable -> represents desired output or classification.

Example: In an image classification task, labeled data would consist of images along with their corresponding class labels (for example, cat, dog, car). 


Unlabeled data -> do not have -> associated labels or target variables. 

Example: A collection of images without any labels or annotations



Structured data -> organized and formatted 

Tabular data: Spreadsheets, databases, or CSV files
Rows -> instances 
Columns -> features or attributes.


Time-series data -> sequences of values measured at successive points in time, such as stock prices, sensor readings, or weather data.



Unstructured data -> lacks predefined -> format, such as text, images, audio, and video. 


Text data: This includes documents, articles, social media posts, and other textual data.


Image data: This includes digital images, photographs, and video frames.





ML learning -> three categories: 
1. supervised learning
2. unsupervised learning
3. reinforcement learning.



In supervised learning -> trained on labeled data. 

Unsupervised learning -> learn from unlabeled data.


Reinforcement learning -> given performance score as guidance 

Semi-supervised learning -> Feedback is provided in the form of rewards or penalties for its actions, and the machine learns from this feedback to improve its decision-making over time.



After model trained -> using information that a model has learned to make predictions or decisions. This is called inferencing.

1. batch inferencing
2. real-time inferencing.



Batch inferencing -> computer analyze data all at once

Used in data analysis, where speed is not as crucial as the accuracy of the results.
